## 💡 Summary/Abstract

**We aim to create a recipe manager that provides
personalization and organization to keep cooking
efficient and productive for newer cooks & active
and health-conscious individuals.** The recipe
manager is designed to help users on their mission to
improve their long-term diet in favor of homemade
meals rather than takeout & junk food through the
week. In addition, the recipe manager addresses
important micro-level concerns like following a recipe’s
ingredients & steps while cooking, tracking necessary
ingredients for recipes in a grocery list, and easily
performing CRUD operations on recipes.
