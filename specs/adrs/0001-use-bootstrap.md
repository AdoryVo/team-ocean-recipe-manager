Technical Story: [Create source code file structure & specs (#3)](https://github.com/cse110-fa21-group5/cse110-fa21-group5/issues/3)

## Context and Problem Statement

How can we implement the key design and features of a recipe manager without clunkiness & too much work from scratch? Things like page navigation, low clutter, organized structure, and ease of access are very important for our users to minimize the learning curve and maximize efficiency & productivity.

## Considered Options

-	Bootstrap
-   Material Design
-   Styling from scratch

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Bootstrap", because is one of the easiest to pick up frameworks but also one of the most thorough. It includes easy-to-learn styling for grid/flex structure, baseline styling for typical elements, and functionality for dynamic elements like moving drawers, modals, and collapses.

### Positive Consequences

-   Baseline styling for many elements
-   Less work for implementing dynamic front-end
-   Accessible docs for styling 
-   More options and possibilities for functionality

### Negative Consequences

-   A similar looking product to other teams & projects
-   Potentially increased learning curve for front-end team
-   Another dependency added to the project
-   Styling is more of a black box - harder to override
