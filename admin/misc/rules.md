## 2) Primary Means and Expectations of Communication  
- Post your messages in their appropriate Slack channels based on topic for clear and different usage.
  - Check the description of the channel to see if your message topic matches. (right-click channel name -> "Open channel details")
- Use `@channel` to send important messages intended for every member to read.
- Communicate when another member's task is blocking your progress/task.
- Don't chat on unrelated things in tech/info channels.
- Expected response time during the day is 3-4 hours.
- If someone posts an idea or prompt, at least react to it with an emoji.

## 3) Scheduling Meetings
- Meeting dates should be planned 4 days in advance.
- Read the meeting minutes on the day of the meeting if you cannot attend it.
- Meetings should last no longer than an hour.
- Meetings should aim to end ~5 minutes early to avoid meeting fatigue hopping between meetings.
- Try to attend all meetings that you agree to attend.
- Respect working hours.

## 4) Responsibilities for Team Members
- Respect individual differences between members.
- Be honest and show your empathy.
- Put your best effort into tasks and finish them on time.
- Be polite.
- Communicate clearly and try to compile the entire group's ideas before making decisions.
- Trust your team.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help.

## 5) Conflict Resolution
- Leaders should openly communicate with group members not following the rules.
- Set up meetings to discuss appropriate solutions & adjustments for conflicts.
- Listen to what the other person is saying instead of preemptively acting and ask questions to clarify your understanding.
- Summarize the areas of agreement and disagreement, ask the other person if they agree with your assessment, modify your assessment until both of you agree on the areas of conflict.
- Try complimenting the other personâ€™s insights and achievements. (Recall "Yes, and..." from lecture)

## 6) Sign!
- Digitally or physically sign the rules & upload a PDF to the repo in `/admin/misc` named as `rules-{First Name}{Last Name}.pdf`. (ex: `rules-adoryvo.pdf`)
