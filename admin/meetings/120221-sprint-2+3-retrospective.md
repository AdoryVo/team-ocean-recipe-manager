## Sprint review

    -   Do not criticize or correct the agile process
-   "This ceremony is usually called a sprint review meeting and it serves as a time for team members to "show and tell" what has been accomplished. Very often stake holders and managers will be invited to this meeting to see the progress made." - Canvas
-   "Do note that the purpose of this meeting is to go over work accomplishment and not to criticize or correct the agile process. Process review and improvement is the main purpose of the retrospective activity and is covered in a separate assignment." - Canvas

## Retrium: Mad-Sad-Glad

### Mad
-	Many members felt overwhelmed and busy during the quarter
-	Some members didn't know how to best keep up to date with the team's progress
	-	**Takeaway:** Bring more focus & attention to standups, progress announcements, meeting notes

### Sad
-	Many members felt kinda lost with the overall project direction
	-	Weren't sure how the work across the different teams would come together
	-	Couldn't easily track the progress & success of the project
	-	**Takeaway:** More inter-team meetings, more push on discussion/manager meeting attendance
-	Hard to balance this quarter with new in-person obligations & situations

### Glad
-	Many members were able to learn some new cool stuff throughout the project
-	Team members still felt trust with asking others for help & catching up
-	We were able to make good progress at a good pace throughout the project
