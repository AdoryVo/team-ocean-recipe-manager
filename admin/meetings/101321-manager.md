## Sprint 0 (Brainstorming)
- In the Agile workflow, sprints are two-week periods of work consisting of certain tasks towards a goal.
- For sprint 0, we will mostly be doing brainstorming and team formation.
  - 3 hours worth of brainstorming is expected to flesh out a clear direction for the project.

### Pressing Assignments
- Should focus right now on the assignments.
  - Be very meticulous and thorough with the team contract to set clear expectations.
  - Keep in mind that changes will be made as we learn from our experiences & failures.
- Take the video seriously.
  - It will be graded relative to the quality of the videos of Sanat's other groups.
    - Can still expect to get a 4/6 to a 6/6 (points).
  - Needs to have intros from each member.
  - Should include team brand, values, & mission.
  - As long as there is clear effort & polish, we can expect full credit. Not just a Zoom recording!
  - Extra credit will be offerred for other assignments too.

### Project Planning Steps
1. Brainstorm and list features the app could have.
2. Categorize the features using the [MoSCoW method.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method)
   - > M - Must have, S - Should have, C - Could have, W - Won't have
   - Think about balancing convenience & necessity.
   - Examples/Suggestions:
     - M: Must have CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
     - S: Should have a search function, serving size scaling
     - C: Could have audiovisual components like images, gifs, and videos.
     - W: The application should DEFINITELY not have React, Angular, ML, AI, image processing, etc.
3. Narrow down a target audience for the application.
   - Create ["user personas"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience)) to characterize the different users in the chosen target market.
4. Rank the features in priority based on the target market.

## Project Expectations
### Team
- Being responsive & reliable on Slack for communication. 
  - **Ensure that everyone has Slack notifications on.**
  - Include contact rule for time period to respond to messages during the day (ex: 3-4 hours from time sent).
- MINIMUM of 1 team meeting per week.
- **Daily standups are expected and checked by the TA.**
  - Standups are daily updates about progress & mood. Should take around 5 minutes.
  - Harder to do traditional synchronous method with overlapping schedules!
  - So, we may use a slack channel with a standup bot that announces when to post standups.
- Meeting notes for all meetings!
- Decreasing bus factor & increasing productivity.
  - Incremental development - planning will prevent time crunches.
  - The more experienced members are responsible for mentoring the new ones.
  - Roles are fluid to accomodate project priorities.

### Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, and JS will be the main things taught throughout the quarter.
  - **So, DON'T WORRY right now if you are unfamiliar with everything - everyone will be on the same page by the end of the quarter!**
  - The team will have to do self-learning & mentorship to implement external tools like Node.js & global databases (ex: MongoDB). 
  - CSS frameworks like Bootstrap are OK!
    - CAUTION: If we rely too much on Bootstrap, we run a high risk of designing an app very similar to others'.
- Local database (session & cookie storage) vs. global database (SQL, MongoDB, etc.)
  - Implementing local will be taught in class, BUT it may be more hassle for the user.
  - Global allows for ease of access for the user, BUT it will be a harder learning curve for many team members.
    - Data security is also a concern.
  - *So, perhaps try a local method for the MVP and move to global if more time is available.*

## Sprint 1 (Design & Planning)
- We should have around two people on design and two on planning.
- What do we do with the remaining members? Reallocate!
  - Back-end & building shouldn't have too much work in this phase -> mentor/learning phase or switch roles.
  - Front-end should work with design to inform what is feasible to code.
  - As soon as design finishes structure, front-end can begin working on coding a skeleton of the structure (no styling!).
    - Can find out what works and what doesn't in a timely manner!
- Miro & Figma will be two handy tools for this!
  - Miro simulates a collaborative whiteboard for brainstorming and organizing ideas.
  - Figma is a collaborative tool for UI Design - designing wireframes in low and high fidelity.
- **A goal of sprint 1 is to make sprints 2 and 3 as smooth as possible - just implementing, styling, & testing!**
