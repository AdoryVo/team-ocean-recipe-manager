## Preparing for Development

-   Less urgent:
    -   Fix pitch
    -   Finish hi-fidelity wireframes
-   Urgent:
    -   Come up with user stories (tasks)
    -   Develop project roadmap/timeline
    -   Assign roles & tasks

### User stories

-   CRUD operations
    -   Creating recipes (scraping)
        -   Storage
    -   Viewing a recipe
        -   Scaling serving size
        -   Mark off ingredients & mark steps
    -   Updating/editing a recipe
        -   Manual form
        -   Scraping from the web
    -   Deleting recipes
-   Nutrition facts
-   Grocery list
-   Meal prep calendar
-   Database + Accounts

### Project roadmap/timeline

-   Pair programming!
-   Early phase: End of this sprint + next sprint
    -   Front-end: HTML structures for views (expected Monday)
        -   Basic containers for different sections
        -   Static HTML for components - don't worry about shadow DOM yet
        -   Focus on CRUD pages
    -   Back-end: Exploratory programming
        -   Scraping recipes from online
            -   Analyze general formats of JSON LD 
        -   Test API's and narrow down most important functions/features
        -   Working with local storage - how to store recipe data
            -   Later: More defined schemas for things we store
-   Project phase:
    -   Combining front-end and back-end
        -   Using local storage to populate recipe view with stored recipe data
        -   Front-end buttons to edit local storage (CRUD)
        -   Integrating API's w/ recipe data for extra info on front-end
            -   Nutrition
    -   Implementing hi-fidelity
    -   Implementing pipeline & testing
        -   Discussed in later labs
        -   One person each from front-end and back-end
