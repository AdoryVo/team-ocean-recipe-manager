    -   Do not criticize or correct the agile process
-   "This ceremony is usually called a sprint review meeting and it serves as a time for team members to "show and tell" what has been accomplished. Very often stake holders and managers will be invited to this meeting to see the progress made." - Canvas
-   "Do note that the purpose of this meeting is to go over work accomplishment and not to criticize or correct the agile process. Process review and improvement is the main purpose of the retrospective activity and is covered in a separate assignment." - Canvas
