# Project Pitch

## Info

### Main Topics

-   Reviewing brainstorm progress
    -   Thoroughly completed necessary artifacts except user stories
        -   User stories are basically just statements of purpose behind features
    -   Target audience is clear & creative - other groups are just doing broke college students
-   Project execution logistics
    -   Distributing & deciding roles
    -   Task implementation flow
    -   Preparation -> Work
-   Project pitch details
    -   Will contain all of our essential project artifacts like user stories, wireframes, etc.
    -   The five ingredients mentioned in the Shape Up book
        -   Problem, appetite, solution, rabbit holes, no gos

## Reviewing Brainstorm Progress

-   We have thoroughly completed necessary artifacts except user stories
    -   User stories are basically just statements of purpose behind features
-   Target audience is clear & creative - many other groups are targeting broke college students
-   Features are well organized
    -   Choose 2 simple features & 1 complex feature to aim for
        -   Work on them in the order Simple -> Simple -> Complex to ensure we have at least two simple features in our final product
    -   CalorieNinja & Spoonacular make implementing nutrition facts simple
-   Paprika is a solid reference for a good recipe manager

## Project Execution Logics

-   Organizing team member roles
    -   Decide right after pitch
    -   (w/ team leads) -> 4 front-end, 4 back-end, 1 pipeline
        -   Front-end & back-end can be split into subteams of pairs
            -   Pair up to balance experience levels - 1 mentor & 1 learner
                -   Increase bus factor by spreading experience!
            -   Pair programming?
        -   Subteams should have their own additional meetings
-   In the upcoming phase, after we decide user stories, we should be
    -   Researching API's
    -   Specs: Determining commit/coding guidelines ASAP before any real coding happens
        -   Pull requests to prevent merge conflicts
        -   Use Wiki in GitHub to link finished external artifacts to our repo
    -   Doing exploratory coding to determine feasible ways to implement features
    -   Testing - not sure exactly
        -   Basic CI pipeline & documented specs for it
-   Afterwards...
    -   Emphasize the importance of clear direction & communication
    -   Follow project roadmap!
        -   CR -> UD -> Simple -> Simple -> Complex
        -   Hard deadlines for tasks
            -   If someone can't do something, notify & have someone cover ASAP

## Project Pitch Details

-   General pitch expectations are explained in [the "Write the Pitch" chapter](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.5-chapter-06) of the Shape Up online book
    -   1. Problem
        -   Include some of the problems we came up with in our brainstorming session
    -   2. Appetite
        -   Our time is fixed - what constraints does that place on our solution
        -   Ex: Tech stack, amount of features, etc.
    -   3. Solution
        -   Features
        -   Visualizations: Wireframes, user flowchart
    -   4. Rabbit holes
        -   Things we need to think about and address
        -   Random complications in the future that we might run into
            -   Ex: Will our product be mobile responsive?
            -   Ex: How are we going to deploy? Custom domain?
    -   5. No-gos
        -   The "Won't Have's" from the MoSCoW method
            -   React, Angular, ML/AI, etc.
        -   Design decisions that we are not implementing
            -   Could be too complex
            -   Could be uncharacteristic for our target audience
        -   What the constraints from our appetite may prevent us from doing
            -   We don't have much time - the basics will have to do!

## Additional Remarks

### Remaining Questions / Concerns

-   How to do proper testing?
-   Is pair programming something we should do often?

---

## Decisions & Takeaways

-   Our target audience & features are good to go!
-   Make sure to nail down project logistics before actually starting
