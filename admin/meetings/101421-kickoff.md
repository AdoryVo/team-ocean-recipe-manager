## Team Expectations (What to expect & what is expected)
- Being responsive & reliable on Slack for communication. 
  - **Ensure that everyone has Slack notifications on - computer & phone.**
    - At least, for direct messages & mentions.
  - Include contract rule for time period to respond to messages during the day (ex: 3-4 hours from time sent).
- MINIMUM of 1 team meeting per week.
- **Implemented next week: Daily standups are expected and checked by the TA.**
  - Standups are daily updates about progress & mood. Should take around 5 minutes.
  - Harder to do traditional synchronous method with overlapping schedules!
  - So, we may use a slack channel with a standup bot that announces when to post standups.
- There will be meeting notes for all meetings!
- Discussion sections are basically mandatory.
- Knowing each other's names! 
  - Could be on a future quiz.
  - Quizlet?
- No expectations for web dev familiarity - just effort and cooperation!
  - The essential HTML, CSS, and JS will be taught throughout the quarter.
  - No one gets left behind! If you need help, just let us know!
  - **So, DON'T WORRY right now if you are unfamiliar with everything - everyone will be on the same page by the end of the quarter!**

## Contract Brainstorm
- [See Canvas assignment](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/30736/assignments/361782)
- Basic rules and expectations to follow throughout the project.
- Four main categories to brainstorm:
  1. Communication means & expectations - rules for Slack etiquette & response times,
  2. Meetings & planning - ex: how long in advance should decisions/meetings be planned & scheduled
  3. Responsibilities for team members - rules pertaining to values like humility, respect, trust, etc.
  4. Conflict resolution - what to do if a team member is bringing down the team by not adhering to rules

## Additional Remarks
### Remaining Questions / Concerns
- When/How should the specs be fleshed out?
  - Who will do it?

--- 

## Decisions & Takeaways
- Sprint 0 (Weeks 3 & 4) are mainly brainstorming and team formation.
- Assignments
	- We'll submit the assignments & give more info on tasks for team members accordingly
	- Aquatic-based theme/brand seemed ok
		- Will compile the branding ideas and post more detailed guidelines for the video
	- Will send finished/prototype contract for feedback & signing
- Become familiar with the team expectations!
- This group experience is new to us all - we'll get more familiar with each other and figure it out as time goes by.
- We'll try to make the meeting flow a bit smoother, we just need more time to figure it out.
