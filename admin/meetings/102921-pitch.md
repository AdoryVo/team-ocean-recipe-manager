## Reviewing Brainstorm Progress

    -   User stories are basically just statements of purpose behind features
-   Target audience is clear & creative - many other groups are targeting broke college students

## Project Pitch Details

-   Assignment details from Canvas:
    -   A slide deck or document (we're doing a slide deck)
    -   The five ingredients of a pitch (below)
    -   Statement of purpose
    -   User personas
    -   System diagrams
    -   Wireframes
-   Five ingredients from Shape Up:
    1.  **Problem** — The raw idea, a use case, or something we’ve seen that motivates us to work on this
    2.  **Appetite** — How much time we want to spend and how that constrains the solution
    3.  **Solution** — The core elements we came up with, presented in a form that’s easy for people to immediately understand
    4.  **Rabbit holes** — Details about the solution worth calling out to avoid problems
    5.  **No-gos** — Anything specifically excluded from the concept: functionality or use cases we intentionally aren’t covering to fit the appetite or make the problem tractable
-   Referencing previous team pitches (**#proj-specs**)
